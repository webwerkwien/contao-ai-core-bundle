/**
 * Removes credentials from anything that leaves the server.
 *
 * ## Why this replaced two pattern lists
 *
 * Until 2026-09-02 the masking lived twice — `AiStreamController::maskSecrets()`
 * and an inline copy in `CliBridgeController` — and both knew exactly three
 * shapes: `sk-ant-…`, `sk-` plus alphanumerics, and `Bearer …`. Measured against
 * seven realistic key formats, four went through unmasked, including **OpenAI's
 * current `sk-proj-…`**: the old `\bsk-[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}` breaks at the hyphen
 * after `proj`. That gap predated the provider expansion; adding four providers
 * merely widened it.
 *
 * 🎯 **A pattern list guesses what a secret looks like, and it goes stale with
 * every provider that ships a new prefix.** The decisive fix is the other way
 * round: we *hold* the user's key, so we can strike the literal value. That also
 * covers the case no pattern ever could — an opaque key with no prefix at all,
 * like Mistral's.
 *
 * The patterns stay as a net for secrets we do *not* hold: a bearer token from
 * somewhere else, a key pasted into a prompt by a user.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in the core bundle (moved 2026-09-04)
 *
 * It was written in the backend bundle, where the first two call sites were.
 * {@see ErrorReportBuilder} needs the same masking and lives here, because the
 * CLI needs reports too and cannot depend on the backend bundle. Copying the
 * pattern list into the core would have restored precisely the duplication this
 * class was created to remove — the third copy is not better than the second.
